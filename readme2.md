# Random Forest Classifier for Emotion Classification

This project implements a Random Forest classifier to predict emoticon-based sentiments from a dataset. The model evaluates its performance using different proportions of the training data, enabling insights into how the size of the training data affects model accuracy.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to classify emoticon sequences into binary labels (e.g., positive vs. negative emotions) using a Random Forest classifier. By examining various training data proportions, the model allows for an analysis of the relationship between the amount of training data and the validation accuracy. This helps determine how much data is necessary for optimal performance.

## Data Preparation

### Dataset
The dataset consists of sequences of emoticons, where each sequence is paired with a corresponding binary label representing the emotion (e.g., happy or sad). Each sequence is treated as an individual data point in the classification task.

### Preprocessing
1. **Splitting the Data:** 
   - The dataset is divided into training and validation sets. This ensures that the model can be trained on one subset of the data while evaluating its performance on another. This separation helps prevent overfitting.
  
2. **Feature Selection:** 
   - Emoticon sequences are processed and vectorized to convert them into a format suitable for model training. This could involve techniques like one-hot encoding or using embeddings, depending on the specifics of your dataset.

## Training and Evaluation

The Random Forest model is trained on varying percentages of the training dataset, specifically from 20% to 100%. The goal is to evaluate how the size of the training data influences the model's performance.

### Training Process:
- **Model:** The classifier used is `RandomForestClassifier`, which is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) of the individual trees.
  
- **Number of Estimators:** The model uses 100 decision trees (`n_estimators=100`). More trees generally improve the model's performance, but with diminishing returns in terms of accuracy.
  
- **Random State:** The random state is set to 42 (`random_state=42`) to ensure reproducibility. This means that every time the model is trained, the same random selections will be made, allowing for consistent results.

- **Validation Accuracy Measurement:** After each training phase, the model's accuracy is calculated on a separate validation set. This metric provides insight into how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

The results for each proportion of the training data used are printed, which include:
- **Validation Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified instances in the validation set.
- **Confusion Matrix:** A table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model, indicating the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- **Classification Report:** A detailed report that includes metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive overview of the model's performance.

## Performance Analysis

The model's performance is assessed using various metrics from the `sklearn` library, including:
- **Accuracy Score:** Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Offers a visual representation of the model's performance, allowing easy identification of where misclassifications occur.
- **Classification Report:** Summarizes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class, providing deeper insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses.

The validation accuracy is recorded for each proportion of the training data, allowing for a visual representation of accuracy against the percentage of training data used. This can help in understanding how increasing training data impacts the model's performance, guiding future data collection and model training strategies.

## Conclusion

This project effectively demonstrates the use of a Random Forest classifier for emotion classification based on emoticon sequences. By analyzing different training data proportions, valuable insights can be gained regarding the importance of data quantity in machine learning model training. 

The methodology applied here can be adapted for other classification tasks, making it a versatile approach for various types of sequential data.
